; Purpose: implementing a basic English sentence validity checker using a 
;   context-free grammar
;   
;   G = (V, Î£, R, S)
;       V = {S, NP, VP, PP, N, V, Det, Adj, Adv}
;       Î£ = {a, b, c, ... , x, y, z}
;       S = S

; ===============

            [list "see" "V"]
            [list "the" "Det"] 
            [list "thing" "N"]
            [list "over" "P"]
            [list "hedge" "N"]
            ))

;; Test phrase using command line arguments
(define phr
  (vector->list (current-command-line-arguments)))

(type_of phr l)  ;; return the phrase type
